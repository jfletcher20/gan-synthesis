# GAN-synthesis
GAN human face synthesis project for Biometric Systems course.

PyTorch + Jupyter Notebook implementation.

The preprocessor should be run separately to adjust the dataset by detecting faces and cropping in a 128x128 area around them.
This area can be changed by calling the crop_face function with a different tuple.
Adjust the directory paths as needed.
